# faster than 91.36% of MySQL online submissions
# This solution incorporates the chances of having more than one customers with same number of largest orders by using ranking.
# dense_rank allows for ranking in consecutive numbers, without skipping numbers in case of more than one place holders for a rank.
# Note - as given in leetcode solution, only using limit 1 after ordering by count(order_id) desc after group by will yeild only 1 top-most record,
# and if data has more than 1 customers placing largest orders, the result will be incorrect
# P.S. Just saw the follow up question after writing above description! So, all good.
