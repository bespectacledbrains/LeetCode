Table: Tree

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| p_id        | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
The given structure is always a valid tree. Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree. Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

```
select t.id as ID, case when t.p_id is null then 'Root'  
                when id in (select distinct a.p_id from tree a) then 'Inner'
                else 'Leaf' 
                end as TYPE
from tree t
order by t.id
```
