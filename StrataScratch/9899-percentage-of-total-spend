Percentage Of Total Spend
Calculate the percentage of the total spend a customer spent on each order. 
Output the customerâ€™s first name, order details, and percentage of the order cost to their total spend across all orders. 
Assume each customer has a unique first name (i.e., there is only 1 customer named Karen in the dataset) and that customers place at most only 1 order a day.
Percentages should be represented as fractions
Tables: orders, customers
